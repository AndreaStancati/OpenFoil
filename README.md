# OpenFoil
Opensource Foiling Projects
I’m receiving tons of requests for the stickers. This is something I like to give to friends and fellow foilers not for profit  to use for fun and as an “advocacy tool”. 
👉🏻It is very personal for us living in #Switzerland since efoils are banned on Swiss inland waters (so we go on the French or Italian side of the same lake and throw gang signs🖕🏼at the 🇨🇭swiss water police across the border 🏴‍☠️).
⚠️This is an “Open Source” initiative, so feel free to dm to receive the JPG file and get them printed on your own (if you want them to last, get high quality vinyl). You can also do tshirts, mugs, hats. As long as you don’t sell it. Ok also as a giveaway to your customers.
😇Please keep it honest and do not alter or use the imagery for profit. I have minted the NFT version.
P.S. in version 2.0 I have removed the IG QR code and replaced it with a more discrete text handle on the bottom left side
